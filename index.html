            <P> Education has always been my mark I have always stived to stay updated after receiving my MBA.
                 I became a human resource professional/accounting for over five years. I had experience 
                 a moment of clarity that lead me to coding bootcamp. I needed a new career change one that was 
                 different and allowed me to learn something new. It did not help that I had no experience in 
                 computer programing. Coding boot camp has been tough from learning about html,csc,java scrip. 
                 However, with my precistance I have overcome a lot of personal obsticles.
            </P>
